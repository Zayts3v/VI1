SHADERC_WRAPPER

This win32 wrapper is as a simple C DLL that exports the C functions 
within shaderc_combined.lib

The wrapper exists to ease the use of shaderc on the windows platform.
The default shaderc_combined.lib shipping with the Vulkan SDK is built
using a specific C++ runtime, which can easily clash with the runtimes
used by other projects.

all symbols are exported via shader_wrapper.def
